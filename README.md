# Distributed_System_Project
This is a project in which I have developed a Car Hire Booking System using the JAX-RS/Jersey, Java RMI and JAXB frameworks and a Web Client page that allows the users to Create/Read/Update/Delete bookings for a specific vehicle for a given set of dates. 
The Web Client will interact with a RESTful Web Service - displayed on an Apache Tomcat Server - which acts as a RMI client to a RMI Database Server.
 

***
## Run
First and foremost, you will need to install [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and [Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi) and [Eclipse JEE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/helios/sr2/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers) (if not already installed) and make an account on [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) because you are going to need the browser [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=ro) .

### 1. Clone Repo <br>
Open your terminal/cmd in the folder you wish to download the repository and execute the following <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```> git clone https://github.com/cristina1997/Emerging_Technologies_Project.git```

### 2. Create RMI <br>
Open your Eclipse JEE <br>
##### Create Java Project
      > Go to -> File -> New Project -> Other -> Java Project and type RMI as the Project Name <br>
Open your terminal/cmd in the project folder <br>
Copy the src and lib folders from the cloned repository and paste it into the RMI project that you created

##### Import Libraries
      > Go to -> File -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Add External JARs
      > Go to -> lib - the folder copied inside the RMI project

### 3. Create REST <br>
##### Add Server
    Go to the "Servers" tab in Eclipse, and click the link to create a new server. 
    Select "Tomcat v7.0 Server" and click Next. 
    
   Browse to the Tomcat directory from Step 1 and then click Finish â€“ "Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost" should be displayed on the "Servers" tab. 
    
#### Create Maven
    > Go to -> File -> New Project -> Maven Project -> Next -> Next <br>
    > Add Archetype <br>
    Type > org.glassfish.jersey.archtype in the Group Id <br>
    Type > jersey-quickstart-webapp in the Artifact ID <br>
    Type > 2.16 in the Archtype Version then click OK <br>
    Enter ie.gmit.sw as the Group Id (package name) <br>
    Enter Jersey_Rest as the Artifact Id <br>
    Click Finish
    
Open your terminal/cmd in the project folder <br>
Copy the src folder from the cloned repository and paste it into the RMI project that you created

#### HTTPServlet library not found ERROR
    > Go to > Properties -> Project Facets -> Runtimes and make sure that Apache Tomcat v7.0 is checked <br>
    
### 4. MySQL Database <br>
##### Add Database
    Double click on WAMP to get it running
    Go the the hidden icons and click on WAMP
    > Go to -> MySQL -> MySQL Console
    Copy from the Database.sql and paste into the console

### 5. XML to Java Converter
    Go to Schema.xsd and notice the code there. That is the XML code that will be generated into Java code for the models
    Open your terminal/cmd in the project folder <br>    
    > xjc -d "location of  your project folder" -p gmit.Model "location of your Schema.xsd file" 
    Press Enter

### 6. Run
#### RMI
     Right click on the RMI project
     > Go to -> Run As -> Java Application <br>
#### REST
     Right click on the REST project
     > Go to -> Run As -> Run on Server <br>
     
### 7. Postman
    Open Postman extension and log in. <br>
    Enter URL in the URL bar http://localhost:8080/Jersey_Rest/webapi/myresource. <br>
